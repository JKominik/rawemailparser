This comand line program will parse a .eml or .txt file.

It specifially looks for the Date Sent, who it is From, who it is To, the Subject of the email as well as the option to view Plain Text or HTML. By default it will read Plain Text.

To run the program create a folder with this file in it. Add the file you are looking to parse into it. There is a section to add the name of your file. Add your filename there WITH the extention. 

Once the file name is in place, in your comandline within the project directory run 

'ruby emailparser.rb'

This will output into your comandline the afformentioned data. 

Moving forward with this I would like to focus on the specifics of what each part of the raw EML does and see the functionality of why these part work together.
